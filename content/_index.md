# Apache Flink

**Apache Flink** is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over *unbounded* and *bounded* data streams. Flink has been designed to run in *all common cluster environments* perform computations at *in-memory* speed and at *any scale*.


### Learn Flink

* To dive in deeper, the Hands-on Training includes a set of lessons and exercises that provide a step-by-step introduction to Flink.

* The Concepts section explains what you need to know about Flink before exploring the reference documentation.
